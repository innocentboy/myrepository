Release of Sjinn 0.9.1 (Tx/Rx hex, --hex, and --hex+, support)
 * Added support for \h control character in send strings
   \h enables hex mode the 2nd \h returns to ASCII mode.
   example:  rs232 -s "\h65 66 67\h\n"
 * Added support for --hex and --hex+ options to display read buffer
   in hex or ASCII over hex.

Release of Sjinn 0.9.1.1 (wait/pause options float support)
 * Had added a 'sanity check' on wait/pause options before initial release...
   Sanity check uses isdigit which does not recognize decimal points. Changed
   ck_atof function to accept decimal points (since pause/wait options
   are float values).

Release of Sjinn 0.9.1.2
 * Changed error handling method in RS232main.c and RS232ctl.c to exit
   more gracefully when errors occur.
 * Changed hex code verbose display from <0x##> to (##), the number is
   actually the hex number converted to decimal. It is now represented 
   properly.
 * Added ChangeLog, sjinn.html, and EXAMPLES.
 * Modified README and INSTALL.
