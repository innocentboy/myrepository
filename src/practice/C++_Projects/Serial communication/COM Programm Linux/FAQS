WHY DO SOME EXAMPLES USE RS232 and OTHERS USE SJINN?
or I RAN the INSTALLATION but WHERE is the PROGRAM?
The executable created will be located in the source directory and will be
called rs232. The installation script should have copied rs232 into
/usr/local/bin and created a symbolic link in /usr/local/bin call sjinn which
points to rs232.

WHEN I RUN SJINN IT HANGS, WHAT DO I DO?
If you previously connected to a PPP server using a modem on the SAME serial
port as your test device is connected to just start up minicom and exit out
with ctrl-A Q and select YES to leave without reset (you don't need to do
anything in minicom itself) from then on everything should work fine. Your
other option is to reboot.

I am UNABLE to COMMUNICATE with the DEVICE, WHAT DO I DO?
Common problems include too short of wait times (see -w option),
improper command terminations (i.e. using '\n' instead of '\r' or not
terminating the command at all), not reading enough characters (for most
devices it won't hurt to specify more characters than needed, i.e. -r2555),
and neglecting to use a null modem cable when the device you are
communicating with is also configured as a DTE device. If all else
fails first RTFM for the device. If you're still having problems post your
questions at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/sjinn>, or e-mail me
<bpeterso@aspenresearch.com>.
