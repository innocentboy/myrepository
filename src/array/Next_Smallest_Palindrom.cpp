/**

Given a number, find the next smallest palindrome

Given a number, find the next smallest palindrome larger than
this number. For example, if the input number is “2 3 5 4 5″, the output
should be “2 3 6 3 2″. And if the input number is “9 9 9″, the output should be “1 0 0 1″.

/**
FOR GETTING THE SMMALEST PALINDROM THAT IS GREATER THAN THE GIVEN NO.
WE WILL TAKE THE MIRROR OF LEFT AND JUST PAST IT TO THE RIGHT.
