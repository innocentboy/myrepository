BLOSOM ALGRTIHM FOR GRAPH MATCHING: The blossom algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory
                                    for constructing maximum matchings on graphs.
                                    Unlike bipartite matching, the key new idea is that an odd-length cycle in the
                                    graph (blossom) is contracted to a single vertex, with the search continuing
                                    iteratively in the contracted graph.
                                    A major reason that the blossom algorithm is important is that it gave
                                    the first proof that a maximum-size matching could be found using a polynomial
                                    amount of computation time.

NOTE: a matching M is maximum if and only if there is no M-augmenting path in G.
