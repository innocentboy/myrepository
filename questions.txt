Q.1: You are given an array of positive integers. Convert it to a sorted array with minimum cost (minimum number of operations). Only valid operation are

1) Decrement -> cost = 1

2) Delete an element completely from the array -> cost = value of element

For example:

4,3,5,6, -> cost 1 //cost is 1 to make 4->3

10,3,11,12 -> cost 3 // cost 3 to remove 3

Q.2: Find the preorder traversal of the binary tree node?
SOLU:  Algorithm:
     A) If current node has left child then return that node.
     B) ELSE IF Current node has right child then this node.
     C) Otherwise if the current node is leaf node  then . point the curent node with the parent node. And keep 
     poiniting the parent node of that node until it's the right child of the parent node. And return the right child
     of the parent node when the node becomes the left child od the parent node.




//*******************************//
Q.3:There is an integer array consisting positive and negative integers. Find maximum positive difference S defined as:
S = a[i] - a[j] where i>j
and
S > 0

SOLU:: A). If S = a[i] - a[j] where i>j (conditiion i>j is not given then):  We would find the max and min element from 
the  array and the difference of them would be the maximum integer value i.e. it would be the final answer.

    B) We would traverse the array and keep the min element till the index as well as the difference of the current
value to the min element. If current element is minimum than min element than update the value of min element with the
current value and also check that current answer is max than difference between the current element and min element.

Q.4:An external system has an array. You are given 3 inbuilt functions which perform their operation in O(1) time.

Elements {a[0]…..a[k] and a[k+1]…..a[n] are already sorted. Give an algorithm to sort in O(n) time and O(1) space.

SOLU: A).you can use an in place merge algo http://thomas.baudel.name/Visualisation/VisuTri/inplacestablesort.html

Let the shortest path be s ->v1->v2->v3->...vn->d.

2) For each link in set  (s->v1,  v1->v2, v2-v3, ..... vn->d):

a)  break the link in G and get the shortest path of the remaining graph.

b) Add the broken link back.
