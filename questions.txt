Q.1: You are given an array of positive integers. Convert it to a sorted array with minimum cost (minimum number of operations). Only valid operation are

1) Decrement -> cost = 1

2) Delete an element completely from the array -> cost = value of element

For example:

4,3,5,6, -> cost 1 //cost is 1 to make 4->3

10,3,11,12 -> cost 3 // cost 3 to remove 3

//********************************//
Q.4:An external system has an array. You are given 3 inbuilt functions which perform their operation in O(1) time.

a) get(i): returns ith element of array

b) length(): returns length of array

c) reverse(i, j): reverses elements of subarray starting from i and ending with j (both inclusive)

write function sortArray() using these three functions.

Q.6:
you have two BST , they contain the same amount of elements “N” but there structure is different. how will you 
cross check that the trees are identical with complexity O(N). Also how will you do the same in case its only 
Binary tree and not a Binary search tree.

Q.7:
Given a graph’s shortest path algorithm, how can you make use of it to find the second shortest path?
SOLU:
Let s be the source and d be the destination node in the graph G.

1) Find the shortest path between s and d using the given shortest path algo.

Let the shortest path be s ->v1->v2->v3->...vn->d.

2) For each link in set  (s->v1,  v1->v2, v2-v3, ..... vn->d):

a)  break the link in G and get the shortest path of the remaining graph.

b) Add the broken link back.

3) Return the minimum of all shortest paths calculated in step 2.

Q.8:I was recently asked this question during my second phone screen for amazon. Given an array containing only 0s and 1s, find the minimum size of subarray containing exactly k-zeros.

Ex. 11010100011

result = 5(01000)

I was able to give an O(n^2) solution but couldn’t do better. Any ideas for a better approach ?

You can put water to only top glass. If you put more than 1 litre water to 1st glass, water overflow and fill equally both 2nd and 3rd glass. Glass 5 will get water from both 2nd glass and 3rd glass and so on..

If you have X litre of water and you put that water in top glass, so tell me how much water contained by jth glass in ith row.

SOLU:

I  guess zombie is right.

there are 25 cells, suppose you select one of them by 25 chances

then there would be only 16 cells left , which could be selected by , 16 chances

then there would be 9 cells left, therefore total chances are : 25*16*9 / 25*24*23

Suppose We have a log of D-days , and size of each log fine can be Order of n , where n be the number of customer.

In a most generalized situation, you can assume that a customer can visit the same page multiple times in a day or any number of days.

We are interested to find out the number of Distinct customer visited at-least p distinct pages within exactly T days.

Write a program to remove fragment that occur in all strings,where a fragment

is 3 or more consecutive word.

example :

input::

s1 = “It is raining and I want to drive home.”;

s2 = “It is raining and I want to go skiing.”;

s3 = “It is hot and I want to go swimming.”;

output::

s1 = “It is raining drive home.”;

s2 = “It is raining go skiing.”;

s3 = “It is hot go swimming.”;

removed fragment = “and i want to”

i was told that this program will be tested again large files( in example above string are given as a sample)

and then we have to remove fragment from files.so efficiency will be taken into consideration.

Assumptions:Ignore capitalization ,punctuation. but preserve in output.

I told him that i will map the fragment from first string and then search the others, and we actually need to consider 3 length ones only as a 4 length one will implicitly contain two 3 word phrases and the phrases can overlap.

i was stuck when he gave me this kind of example

a a a a a b c b c b c b c

if we are removing fragment “a b c” ,then after removing middle one we got another “a b c” fragment and so on…

SOLU:
There are C(64, 16) ways to pick 16 places where coins can be placed.

In any of the above picked 16 places, there are 16! ways to place coins. Since 8 coins are white and to be 
considered same. Similar logic for black coins. The number of ways reduces to (16!)/(8! * 8!)

Total number of ways to place = C(64, 16)*(16!) / (8! * 8!)
