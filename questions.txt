Q.1: You are given an array of positive integers. Convert it to a sorted array with minimum cost (minimum number of operations). Only valid operation are

1) Decrement -> cost = 1

2) Delete an element completely from the array -> cost = value of element

For example:

4,3,5,6, -> cost 1 //cost is 1 to make 4->3

10,3,11,12 -> cost 3 // cost 3 to remove 3
