Q.1: You are given an array of positive integers. Convert it to a sorted array with minimum cost (minimum number of operations). Only valid operation are

1) Decrement -> cost = 1

2) Delete an element completely from the array -> cost = value of element

For example:

4,3,5,6, -> cost 1 //cost is 1 to make 4->3

10,3,11,12 -> cost 3 // cost 3 to remove 3

Q.7:
Given a graph’s shortest path algorithm, how can you make use of it to find the second shortest path?
SOLU:
Let s be the source and d be the destination node in the graph G.

1) Find the shortest path between s and d using the given shortest path algo.

Let the shortest path be s ->v1->v2->v3->...vn->d.

2) For each link in set  (s->v1,  v1->v2, v2-v3, ..... vn->d):

a)  break the link in G and get the shortest path of the remaining graph.

b) Add the broken link back.

3) Return the minimum of all shortest paths calculated in step 2.

removed fragment = “and i want to”

i was told that this program will be tested again large files( in example above string are given as a sample)

and then we have to remove fragment from files.so efficiency will be taken into consideration.

Assumptions:Ignore capitalization ,punctuation. but preserve in output.

I told him that i will map the fragment from first string and then search the others, and we actually need to consider 3 length ones only as a 4 length one will implicitly contain two 3 word phrases and the phrases can overlap.

i was stuck when he gave me this kind of example

a a a a a b c b c b c b c

if we are removing fragment “a b c” ,then after removing middle one we got another “a b c” fragment and so on…
